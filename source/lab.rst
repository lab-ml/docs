Lab
====

This library helps you organize and track machine learning experiments.


Features
--------

Main features of Lab are:

* Organizing experiments
* `Dashboard <https://github.com/vpj/lab_dashboard/>`_ to browse experiments
* Logger
* Managing configurations and hyper-parameters

Organizing Experiments
----------------------

Lab keeps track of all the model training statistics. It keeps them in a SQLite database and also pushes them to Tensorboard. It also organizes the checkpoints and any other artifacts you wish to save. All of these could be accessed with the Python API and also stored in a human friendly folder structure. This could be of your training pro Maintains logs, summaries and checkpoints of all the experiment runs in a folder structure.


`Dashboard <https://github.com/vpj/lab_dashboard/>`_ to Browse Experiments

The web dashboard helps navigate experiments and multiple runs. You can checkout the configs and a summary of performance. You can launch TensorBoard directly from there.

`Eventually, we want to let you edit configs and run new experiments and analyze outputs on the dashboard.`


Logger
------

Logger has a simple API to produce pretty console outputs. It also comes with a bunch of helper functions that manages iterators and loops.

Manage configurations and hyper-parameters
------------------------------------------

You can setup configs/hyper-parameters with functions. `Lab <https://github.com/vpj/lab/>`_  would identify the dependencies and run them in topological order.

.. code-block:: python

  @Configs.calc()
  def model(c: Configs):
        return Net().to(c.device)


You can setup multiple options for configuration functions. So you don't have to write a bunch if statements to handle configs.

.. code-block:: python

    @Configs.calc(Configs.optimizer)
    def sgd(c: Configs):
        return optim.SGD(c.model.parameters(), lr=c.learning_rate, momentum=c.momentum)

    @Configs.calc(Configs.optimizer)
    def adam(c: Configs):
        return optim.Adam(c.model.parameters())
